>! No current limiting circuit is included, as the adjustable current source donÂ´t give more than 200 mA when connected directly to this laser. Although this laser was tested at 200 mA for 5 min without degrading its output power, it is recommended not to operate with currents higher than those recommended by the manufacturer to avoid damage to the laser.
