# Blue Laser
For more information on how these operational measurements were obtained, visit the following link: [Laser diode characterization](laser.md)
>! **Warning** 
>!
>! No current limiting circuit is included, as the adjustable current source doesnâ€™t provide  more than 200 mA when connected directly to this laser. Although this laser was tested at 200 mA for 10 seconds without degrading its output power, it is recommended not to operate with current higher than 135 mA as recommended by the manufacturer to avoid damage to the laser.
