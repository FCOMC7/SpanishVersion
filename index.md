# Modular fiber-coupled laser illumination

The modular fiber coupled laser illumination system is a free and open source device. This system can use lasers with multiple wavelengths, coupled into a single optical fiber, allowing easy digital targeting without structural modifications. Its modular design allows you to reuse and improve individual parts, combine them, exchange them or easily use them on their own.
