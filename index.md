# Low-cost, modular fiber-coupled laser illumination system.

The low-cost, modular fiber-coupled laser illumination system is an open source device that houses a diode laser coupled into a multimode optical fiber, and provides friendly and stable operation. This system can be assembled with lasers of a variety of colors, and has been tested with 488 nm, 405 nm, and 638 nm. Its modular design allows you to reuse and improve individual parts, combine them, exchange them or easily use them on their own.
