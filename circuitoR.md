#Red Laser

>i 
>i To limit the optical power of the laser, a resistance **R1= 2 ohm** is considered. According to the manufacturer's technical specifications, this laser can reach an optical power of 700 mW with a current consumption of 1 A.


The manufacturer's technical specifications can be found in the following link [02c GH0637AA2G 638nm 700mW](docu/02cGH0637AA2G638nm700mW.pdf).
