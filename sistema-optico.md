# Optical Module

>! **Warning** Use nitrile gloves when handling all parts of the optical module. *Take special care with the lenses and the laser fiber.*

## Optical Lens {pagestep}

Shim [inner ring] into [OP tool]. Then, insert into [optical tube] and rotate to a minimum depth of 6mm to later insert lens and second internal ring.

## Optical tubes {pagestep}

For this step, you must have the [optical tube] with its attached lens, assembled in the previous step.

Fit both tubes and turn until the end.

## Base {pagestep}

For this step, you must have the extended optical tube, assembled in the previous step.

Place [clamps] on a horizontal surface at a distance of 25 mm between both parts. Then, assemble optical tube to both [clamps] by pressing down.

## Fiber laser adapter {pagestep}

For this step, you must have the extended optical tube with the clamps, assembled in the previous step.

Fit [laser fiber adapter] and turn all the way.

Remove laser cap, assemble laser with [fiber laser adapter] and turn laser adapter all the way.

>! **Warning** Do not touch fiber optics. Manipulate components as shown in the images.

## Laser aiming surface {pagestep}

For optical safety protocol, it is recommended to use a flat, black surface to point the laser. Included in the kit are 2 [fasteners] and a piece of black cardboard for this purpose.

## Diffuser {pagestep}

To perform optical tests that require the use of [diffuser], follow the following instructions:

* Stick a piece of adhesive tape on the [diffuser] so that the passage of light through it is interfered with.
* Fit [diffuser] into [OP tool] and insert the optical tube through the section closest to the [laser fiber adapter].

## Adjustable Lens Tube {pagestep}

For activity that requires adjusting the position of the lens depending on its focal length, you could replace and use the [adjustable lens tube] part instead of one of the optical tubes.
